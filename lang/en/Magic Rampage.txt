Describe Your App

Magic Rampage is an action-RPG platformer with an adventure touch and exciting storyline with its own turns and twists. It features character customization - classes and specials skills - and equipment management.

Each dungeon introduces the player to new obstacles, enemies and secret areas, including bonus levels, boss fights and survival mode. Refreshed graphics and addicting gameplay mechanics are also among the most attractive features. The game has high replay value and keeps fans engaged by featuring hundreds of hidden rewards and achievement prizes.

With in-game currency, the player can browse and shop for new weapons (swords, axes, magical staves and more) and armour, and also upgrade equipment for more efficiency in battle.

Magic Rampage is fully integrated with Game Center, including achievements and leaderboards, and also supports physical gamepads for more accurate and fun gameplay responsiveness.


Your Story

Magic Rampage is on the App Store since 2015 and has been receiving extremily positive reviews since then. Everything in the game is carefully crafted to provide the best real-time gaming experience.

When it was released, Magic Rampage started off as an episodic game, getting new levels every few weeks. By leaving the players with cliffhangers in the main storyline after each episode, the game has built lots of fan engagement around its plot.

Recently, we've released our last episode of the fourth season, and the newest version features many graphics improvements, increasing its value to the player.

Now that the game has this even more premium touch to it, we were hoping it could get a special spot in the store to increase visibility and the fan base from the App Store.
